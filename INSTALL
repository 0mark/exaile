Linux/*nix
==========

On *nix-based systems, run the following to install:

  $ make
  # make install

The "make" step is optional and only compiles the modules and translations.

There is also an install_no_locale target if you wish to install without 
translations.

Install on OSX
==============

On OSX with macports, you probably want to run the following:

    $ make
    # DEFAULTARGS="--no-hal --no-dbus" PREFIX=/opt/local make install
    
See README.OSX for more information.

Windows
=======

On Windows, using the official Windows installation program is recommended.
See README.Windows for more information.
