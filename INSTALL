Install on OSX
==============

On OSX, using the official OSX installation DMG is recommended.

To build your own Exaile.app, install py2app and run tools/osx/create_dmg.sh.
This will run all of the correct steps to create a DMG image and Exaile
application which you can drag into the Applications directory in finder.

Windows
=======

On Windows, using the official Windows installation program is recommended.
See README.Windows for more information. 

To build your own installer, install NSIS and compile
tools/win-installer/exaile_installer.nsi . This should produce a setup.exe
that you can run to install exaile + dependencies.

Linux/*nix
==========

On *nix-based systems (but not OSX), run the following to install:

  $ make
  # make install

The "make" step is optional and only compiles the modules and translations.

There is also an install_no_locale target if you wish to install without 
translations.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Environment variables that affect "make install":

  LIBINSTALLDIR
    The lib directory to be appended to PREFIX. 
    Default: /lib
  PREFIX
    The installation prefix. 
    Default: /usr/local
    Note: If this default is changed, you may need to set the XDG_DATA_DIRS
      environment variable to include the changed path. See [1].
  XDGCONFDIR
    The directory to install system-wide config files in, following xdg spec. 
    Default: /etc/xdg 
    Note: If this default is changed, you may need to set the XDG_CONFIG_DIRS 
      environment variable to include the changed path. See [1].
  DESTDIR
    Destination directory to put the file structure under. Mainly of use for
      packagers.
    Default: not set (/)
  DEFAULTARGS
    Default arguments that the 'exaile' launcher script (installed to 
    $PREFIX/bin/exaile) will pass to exaile on startup
