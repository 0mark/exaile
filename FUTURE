random thoughts for beyond 0.3.0. many of these are user requests.


migration:
    allow import of libraries/ratings/album art from amarok, etc.
        - we could use the 0.2 -> 0.3 upgrade framework, assuming it
            is made flexibly enough.

ratings system:
    click on rating column to set
    replace current dropdown with a bar of stars widget, allows dragging to 
        partially fill stars, double click fills up through clicked star.
        - could reuse same widget for rating column

UPnP support:
    client
    server
    noone else supports this yet, so this could be quite a boon if done right.

DAAP Server:
    would require patching python-daap to have server support (likely doable)

Playback Bookmarks:
    allow bookmarking places in the audio file for quick jumping to
    UI? (custom cairo-drawn on/near progressbar?)
    auto-save last position

Cuesheet support:
    expose as permanent bookmarks? (would still have to handle metadata change)
    alternately, parse the CUE at import time and create separate tracks for
        each entry. This would require extra work in both player.py and 
        collection.py to handle it correctly, but allows full integration with 
        the rest of exaile's features.

Shuffling albums:
    no clue how to do this UI-wise.

Library structure handling:
    allow exaile to manage the libraries' on-disk structure
    use ex-falso-like system to determine path
    we can then expose in the UI methods of copying tracks directly into this structure
    this is espeically useful for import from mp3players/cds/etc
    if multiple libraries, allow to specify one as default or to choose which to use on each copy.

Video Playback:
    this could be tricky UI-wise. perhaps expose as another tab in playlist view, with buttons to go fullscreen or separate window.
    should probably wait until compiz/video issues are resolved, so we dont have to deal with those complaints.
    use for video podcasts, have a separate collection for videos.
    too heavyweight for main perhaps? (is it possible to do as plugin?)

Audiobooks:
    allow a separate collection for audiobooks
    plugin?
    could be automatic by grabbing eveything with a genre of audiobook, but 
        give right-click menu for manual marking as well.
    automatically save/resume position in book (thru bookmarking support above)

Keybindings:
    allow full user-customizable keybinding support
    this may only be doable for when exaile has focus, idk how to make it work globally without using a C library (though with ctypes I guess we can use that)
    

musicbrainz:
    use for cd tagging

custom stemming:
    allow trimming of 'A', not just 'The'
