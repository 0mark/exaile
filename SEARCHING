Exaile 0.3 introduces a new searching system. This document attempts to 
explain the syntax of the new system.


Example search query:

days artist==flow NOT (album="Complete Best" OR album=OST)

==disccetion of example==
days - general search query, matches any field
artist==flow - matches only the artist "flow", not "flowing" or "the flow"
NOT - exclude items that match the following term
() - parentheses can be used to group terms. without these the
     NOT would only apply to album="Complete Best", with them,
     it applies to everything inside the parentheses.
album="Complete Best" - matches albums that contain the exact 
     phrase "Complete Best", eg "All the complete best"
OR - causes results matching the terms on either side to be 
     returned. the default linker for terms is AND.
album=OST - match albums containing "OST"

so, this query would match tracks by the artist "flow", that are 
in albums not containing "complete best" or "ost", and that 
contain the phrase "days" in any tag.

==list of search operators==

=
syntax: <tag>=<phrase>
effect: match tracks having <phrase> contained in <tag>

>
syntax: <tag>><phrase>
effect: only works on numerical values. matches tracks with <tag> having a
        value greater than <phrase>.

<
syntax: <tag><<phrase>
effect: only works on numerical values. matches tracks with <tag> having a 
        value less than <phrase>.

==
syntax: <tag>==<phrase>
effect: match tracks where <tag> exactly matches <phrase>.

"
syntax: "<word> <word>"
effect: treat multiple words as one phrase instead of several.

NOT, !
syntax: NOT <term>
effect: exclude tracks matching the following term. only affects
        one term after.

OR, |
syntax: <term> OR <term>
effect: include tracks matching either the terms before or after.
        affects only one term before or after.

()
syntax: ( <terms> )
effect: makes the enclosed terms appear as one term to outside
        operators.

==misc notes==
search terms are case-insensitive, but operators are not. thus,
"or" is a phrase while "OR" is an operator.
