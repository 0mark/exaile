PROS:
 - ridiculously fast load
 - can save any state we like
 - no/few threading issues 
 - no extra dependencies

CONS:
 - no built-in sorting
 - memory use?


MAKING IT PRACTICAL:
 - implement our own sort
   - use dicts or similar to monitor all tracks that belong to a particular artist/album/genre. search using this should be 2x faster than just looking through the tags on all tracks.
 - memory
   - not sure how to optimize this, aside from avoiding duplicate objects, which would be handled mostly higher-up, in TrackDB itself.
