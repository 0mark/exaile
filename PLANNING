This is for notes and plans regarding exaile 0.3. 
It should also be used to keep track of what each developer is
currently working on.

Current projects:
    Aren Olson - initial rewrite structuring


==== NOTES ====
xl is to be split into xl and xlgui. All code concerning the display of data and receipt of user input through the gui should go into xlgui. code that is not dependent upon the gui implementation should go in xl.

==== WHAT DO WE WANT? ====
this is perhaps the most important question, since it will shape the development of everything else.
this is not just NEW things, or changes. this is a list of EVERYTHING that we want in 0.3, no more no less. or at least it will be such a list once it is complete.

legend:
 - point
 -! critical point
 -? wishlist/idea
 -& needs info

key ideas:
 - empower users more
 - 'just work'


unsorted:
 - select default amazon/wikipedia settings from system LOCALE
 -? resolve unicode issues
 - allow transcoding files
 - multi-file media support
    - cue/bin
    - wavpack hybrid
 -? guess tag info from filename (and path?) if no tags (eg file://04 - na na na.mp3 -> track:04, title: na na na)


general structure/underpinnings:
 -! make everything modular and reuseable. defined APIs are a good thing.
 -! make many more pluggable APIs
    - playback engine (gstreamer default, xine optional)
    - global media keys (integrate the various plugins for this into core and expose in prefs)
    -? sql engine (default to sqlite)
    - cover art fetcher
    - lyrics fetcher
 - with pluggable APIs, allow prioritization and auto-fallback

gui:
 - allow hiding files pane
 - better consistency in the tabs' interfaces
 -? use libsexy to display album art in tray icon tooltip if available (possible?)
 - make splash sceen appear earlier in start sequence so it has more use
 - allow installing plugins from files

osd:
 - allow hiding progressbar (move pbar into markup?)

discs:
 - integrated cd burner (we can probably borrow code from serpentine)
    -? support cd text
 -? dvd audio/SACD support (does gstreamer support this?)
 - recognize cds via HAL

playlists:
 - move 'built-in' smart playlists to just being 'default' smart playlists, so they become user-editable
   - provide option to restore default smart playlists
 - better import/export (m3u, pls)

streaming:
 - make sure we don't freeze on bad streams/buffering

collection management:
 -? load collection into tree on-demand (see wiki)
 - allow exaile to manage library structure (question: how to handle having multiple library folders?)
 -? use inotify or a FAM to watch for library updates, if available
 - put audiobooks into a separate pane (use gapless for audiobooks, if available)
 -? partiton awareness - don't choke if tracks are umounted

audio engine:
 - allow choosing audio playback device
 - volume normalization / per-track(/album) volume levels
 -? support more than two audio channels
 -? gapless playback / crossfade (settable per-track, per-album?)

devices:
 - detect devices via HAL and configure them automatically
 - seamless transfer/syncronization, including playlists and podcasts
 - support ipod, mtp, and mass storage devices fully
 - support for defining a file layout for media transferred to the device (where applicable)
    -? if already files on the device, look at them to try to figure out the existing layout
    -& default layout
 - transcode tracks when transferred 
    - auto-detect what the device supports (possible?)
    - if device supports lossless and lossy formats, convert lossy files to lossy and lossless to lossless (unless otherwise directed)

podcasts:
 - allow users to choose, when and where to download podcasts
   -& default
 - option to delete saved files when deleting a podcast

last.fm:
 - move support out to a plugin
 - allow playback as well (may require making the playback engine more modular - a good thing)

plugins:
 - port all that are still relevant to new system
 - include some in the default installation
    - all media device plugins
    -? radio plugins?
    -? mini mode
 - a well-defined API, that makes the most commonly needed functions easily accessible
 - make .exz the de facto format (single-file plugins can just be zipped straight)
