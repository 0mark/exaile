This is for notes and plans regarding exaile 0.3. 
It should also be used to keep track of what each developer is
currently working on.

Current projects:
    Aren Olson - Core Rewrite, documentation thereof

Implemented:
    Collection
    Libraries
        no watching or auto-rescan
    Playlists
    Player
    Queue
    Settings
    Event
        signals-like system
    XDG
        exaile's config and data files now stored according to xdg spec

Things that can probably be implemented at this stage:
    Playlist Exporting
        stubs in playlist.py
    Smart Playlists
        again, stub in playlist.py
    Logging System (important!)
        python has a built-in logging module we could build on
    Alternate Playback Systems
        will need more abstraction in player.py, but is feasable
        stub for generic Player class exists
    Make Sorting Use albumartist instead of Artist if available
        trackdb.py
    CD Playback
        just make a Playlist containing the tracks and hold it
        should be able to handle multiple cd devices
        will eventually detect via HAL, not needed in inital version
    Library Watching
        use pyinotify or similar to watch libraries for new tracks
        periodic rescan
        stubs in collection.py


Other Work-Items:
    Gapless Playback
        doable? difficulty?
        cross-fade too?
    Podcasts
    Dynamic Playlists
        I have some fun ideas for this one, best to wait --Aren
    HAL Support
        recognize and autoconfigure CDs and mp3 players via HAL
    MP3 Player Support (very involved, should wait for a while)
        generic classes subclassable for iPod, MTP and MassStorage players
        create a special Collection for each, load Playlists, etc.
        also should handle transfer, nto necessariliy at first
            transcode on transfer also good
            algorithms to handle sync?
            allow custom file layout if applicable
        podcast support
            limit number / autodelete old ?
    Plugins Systems (wait on GUI)
        make exz default format
        port old plugins
    Last.fm
        implement as plugin
    CD Ripping
        wait on CD playback
    CD Burning
        wait on CD playback
    GUI
        this is a big one, should come very late
    Lyrics
        wait on GUI
    Covers
        wait on GUI
    DBUS

==== NOTES ====
xl is to be split into xl and xlgui. All code concerning the display of 
data and receipt of user input through the gui should go into xlgui. code 
that is not dependent upon the gui implementation should go in xl.
