This is for notes and plans regarding exaile 0.3. 
It should also be used to keep track of what each developer is
currently working on.

Current projects:
    Aren Olson - initial rewrite structuring


==== NOTES ====
xl is to be split into xl and xlgui. All code concerning the display of 
data and receipt of user input through the gui should go into xlgui. code 
that is not dependent upon the gui implementation should go in xl.

==== WHAT DO WE WANT? ====
this is perhaps the most important question, since it will shape the 
development of everything else.
this is not just NEW things, or changes. this is a list of EVERYTHING 
that we want in 0.3, no more no less. or at least it will be such a 
list once it is complete.

legend:
 - point
 -! critical point
 -? wishlist/idea
 -& needs info

key ideas:
 - 'just work'
 - empower users more
 - speed


unsorted:
 - select default amazon/wikipedia settings from system LOCALE
 -? resolve unicode issues
 - allow transcoding files
 - multi-file media support
    - cue/bin
    - wavpack hybrid
 -? guess tag info from filename (and path?) if no tags (eg file://04 - 
      na na na.mp3 -> track:04, title: na na na)
    - see similar point on mass storage media players, below.


general structure/underpinnings:
 -! make everything modular and reuseable. defined APIs are a good thing.
 -! make many more pluggable APIs
    - playback engine (gstreamer default, xine optional)
    - global media keys (integrate the various plugins for this into core 
          and expose in prefs)
    -? sql engine (default to sqlite)
      - pickle-based DB persistence? (in-progress, xl/library.py)
    - cover art fetcher
    - lyrics fetcher
 - with pluggable APIs, allow prioritization and auto-fallback where
     applicable/possible.

gui:
 - allow hiding any side pane
 - better consistency in the tabs' interfaces
 -? use libsexy to display album art in tray icon tooltip if 
       available (possible?)
 - make splash sceen appear earlier in start sequence so it has more use
 - allow installing plugins from files

osd:
 - allow hiding progressbar (move pbar into markup?)

discs:
 - integrated cd burner (we can probably borrow code from serpentine)
    -? support cd text
 -? dvd audio/SACD support (does gstreamer support this?)
 - recognize cds via HAL

playlists:
 - move 'built-in' smart playlists to just being 'default' smart playlists, 
       so they become user-editable
   - provide option to restore default smart playlists
 - better import/export (m3u, pls)
 - object inherits from TrackDB, adds an ordered list of Track objects

streaming:
 - make sure we don't freeze on bad streams/buffering

collection management:
 -? load collection into tree on-demand (see wiki)
 - allow exaile to manage library structure (question: how to handle 
     having multiple library folders? global defualt, allow per-library and 
     per-collection choices)
 -? use inotify or a FAM to watch for library updates, if available
 - put audiobooks into a separate pane (use gapless for 
     audiobooks, if available)
 -? partiton awareness - don't choke if tracks are umounted (HAL?)
 -? allow user to maintail multiple collections, backed by different libraries

audio engine:
 - allow choosing audio playback device
 - volume normalization / per-track(/album) volume levels
 -? support more than two audio channels
 -? gapless playback / crossfade (settable per-track, per-album?)

devices:
 - detect devices via HAL and configure them automatically
 - seamless transfer/syncronization, including playlists and podcasts
 - support ipod, mtp, and mass storage devices fully
 - support for defining a file layout for media transferred to 
     the device (where applicable)
   -? if already files on the device, look at them to try to figure 
        out the existing layout
   -& default layout
 - transcode tracks when transferred (only if necessary)
    - auto-detect what the device supports (possible?)
    - if device supports lossless and lossy formats, convert lossy 
        files to lossy and lossless to lossless (unless otherwise directed)

podcasts:
 - allow users to choose when and where to download podcasts
   -& default
 - option to delete saved files when deleting a podcast

last.fm:
 - move support out to a plugin
 - allow playback as well (may require making the playback engine 
     more modular - a good thing)

plugins:
 - port all that are still relevant to new system
 - include some in the default installation
    - all media device plugins
    -? radio plugins?
    -? mini mode
 - a well-defined API, that makes the most commonly needed functions 
       easily accessible
 - make .exz the de facto format (single-file plugins can just be 
       zipped straight)


=== Code Structure ===
use this to plan object layout, interactions, etc. It should also be kept 
updated as items are implemented, since it can then serve as rudimentary
API documentation.

general:
 - use signals to notify about object changes (track info updates in all 
       places in real time!)

song management:
 - xl/library.py # changed from track.py, because often "track" is a name conflict
   - classes
     - TrackDB - database of tracks (pickle, sqlite)
       - signals
         - track_added
         - track_removed
       - methods
         - search(query [, fields]) - search the database, returns a 
               list of Track objects
         - advanced_search(query) - allows more-specific queries 
         - add(track) - add a Track to the DB
         - remove(track) - remove a track from the DB
    # the follwing may not be neccesary, I think the old one can
    # work with only minor modifications.
     - Track 
       - signals
         - info_updated
       - methods
         - is_editable() - whether this track's data can be edited or not
         - load_from_file([filename]) - reloads tags from file, either the 
               specified one or one saved in the object
         - _hold() - stop auto-syncing changes to the TrackDB
         - _commit() - resume auto-syncing changes to the TrackDB, and sync
               any changes that were pending during _hold()
       - notes
         - use python's object customizing abilities to support 
               getting/setting attibutes via Track[attr] 
         - changes made are synced back to the TrackDB and file 
               automatically 
         - will need some shenangling to handle different file types, 
               especially multi-file ones like cue/bin
         - current pickle-based TrackDB will need work to get auto-sync
               working efficiently
 - xl/collection.py
   - classes
     - Collection - based on TrackDB, adds ability to watch directories 
             for new media
       - methods

         - rescan_libraries() - force a rescan of all libraries
         - get_libraries() - returns the list of all libraries
         - remove_library(library) - remove a Library
     - Library - watch a directory for changes and sync them to the 
           associated Collection
       - signals
         - filesystem_changed
       - methods
         - set_location(path) - set the watched path
         - rescan(path) - force a scan of the watched path
         - set_realtime(bool) - watch in real time or not (using pynotify? gamin?)
         - set_rescan_interval(interval) - time between automatic 
             rescans - has no effect if realtime is on
       - notes
         - need to be careful, we probably shouldn't inotify a mounted 
             network share (default realtime to off seems simplest solution)

event handling:
 - xl/event.py
   - notes:
     - intended to replace the current system of signals since they 
           don't cooperate with pickling.
     - also replaces (mostly) gobject's idle_add.
     - could also be used as the basis for a new logging system.
     - example: log_event('track_updated', some_media.Track_instance,
           'file://foobar.mp3')
     - example: log_event('playback_start', Player_instance, Track_instance)
   - functions:
     - log_event(type, object, data, async=True) - creates an Event and 
           logs it to the EventManager
     - set_event_callback(function, type=None, object=None) - sets a 
           callback for an event. function must take three params as
           arguments (type, object, data).
     - idle_add(function, *args) - run function in the background at some 
           point in the future when the computer has free time. Note that
           this should NOT be used for long-running functions as they
           will block other functions from executing until they complete.
   - classes
     - Event(type, object, data)
     - EventManager
       - methods
         - emit(event) - emits an event, block until all callbacks complete
         - emit_async(event) - same as emit() but doesn't block
         - add_callback(function, type=None, object=None)
         - remove_callback(function, type=None, object=None)
     - IdleManager
         - add(func, *args) - underlying implementation for idle_add, above
