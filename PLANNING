* 0.3.0 final (aim for before August 17th!)

Things needed for beta 1 (0.2.999.1) release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * CD Burning
    * part of cd plugin, takes a Playlist and burns it in order
    * use external burners, include option for a custom external
      burner command
      * will migrate to libburn once python bindings become available

  * GUI
    * Tag Editor
      * I'm thinking this shouldn't be anything more than a simple editor
            for the first release.  Something like rhythmbox has.  Even with
            the "more featureful" editor in 0.2.14, I always ended up using
            exfalso for anything more than a few tracks.
        * +1 from me (Aren)
    * right-click menus for side tabs, playlists
    * playlist export
    * lyrics pane
    * properties pane

  * Devices
    * improve device manager with basic prefs, hal-less connections
    * implement cd device panel (ie flat playlist vs collection)
    * implement transfer to device
    * mtp/ipod plugins

  * Conversion - we need to handle the upgrade process from 0.2.14 -> 0.3.0
    * this should include the collection, settings, plugins, playlists, and
      anything else still relevant in 0.3
    * only import it if firstrun is True. 
      * should be in its own folder in xl/ 
    * this should also be designed flexibly enough to also handle future 0.3.x
      to 0.3.y upgrades, should that be necessary. 
    * No need to handle exaile < 0.2.14, its been almost a year so people 
        should have migrated already.


Final
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Launchpad
    * all bugs targeted to 0.3.0 must be resolved or retargeted
    * all critical bugs in 0.2.x must be confirmed fixed in 0.3.0 (barring
      severe techincal problems making them unresolvable)


Optional Milestones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Podcasts
    * separate from radio
    * allow flexibility in choice of when (if?) and where to download
    * allow streaming if not downloaded

  * Blacklisting

  * Visualizations
    * implement as plugin

  * Plugins
    * port all relevant 0.2 plugins to 0.3
