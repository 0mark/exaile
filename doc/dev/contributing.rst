Contributing to Exaile
======================

The exaile team is always looking for others to help contribute to exaile
in various ways:

* Bugfixes
* Documentation updates
* New features + plugins
* Translations

The best way to contribute to the first three is to submit patches via pull
request on GitHub.

If you think your bug report/request is being ignored, it probably isn't. All
of the Exaile developers work on this project in their spare time, and so we
don't always have time to work on specific problems. We *do* try to push good
patches as soon as we can, however. Ping the bug report, or leave a message on
#exaile if we haven't at least made an initial response, sometimes bug report
emails can get lost in the noise or forgotten.
